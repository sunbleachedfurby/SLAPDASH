###### /ˈslapˌdaSH/ random, arbitrary, all over the place

SLAPDASHBOT is curates art with a random word generator. The fruits of WordAPI's random word generator are fed into the search function of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API, harkening an ObjectID. Through the ObjectID, the primaryImage of the object is called, downloaded, and tweeted alongside the computer-generated search term that summoned it. Supported by Tweety and AWS Lambda, SLAPDASHBOT is an exploration of the relationship between art and language, expression and computation, evoking the formers through the latters.
