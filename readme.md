###### /ˈslapˌdaSH/ random, arbitrary, all over the place

SLAPDASHBOT is a Twitterbot exploring the relationship between art and language by evoking the former through the latter. The fruits of WordAPI's random word generator are fed into the search function of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API to harken an ObjectID. Through the ObjectID, an image (primaryImage) of the object is downloaded and tweeted with the word(s) that summoned it. Supported by Tweety and AWS Lambda, SLAPDASHBOT is designed to tweet (nearly) every half hour.
